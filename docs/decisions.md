# Design decisions

Each entry: the decision, the alternatives, and why.

## 2026-09-24 — Build order: walking skeleton first
Reordered the plan so a no-LLM end-to-end version (SQL filters + coverage + deterministic
verifier + CLI) exists after Phase 3. Alternative: finish each layer fully before the next.
Why: a runnable demo early, safety enforced in code from the start, and before/after
numbers for every later improvement.

## 2026-09-24 — Python 3.12
`requires-python >= 3.11`, pinned 3.12 locally. Alternative: 3.14 (installed system Python).
Why: torch, Chroma and sentence-transformers support 3.12 reliably; 3.14 wheels lag.

## 2026-09-24 — Tracing helpers log-only until Phase 5
`trace()` / `span()` / `score()` write structlog JSON now; Langfuse is added behind the
same helpers in Phase 5. Why: code can be instrumented from day one, tests/CI need no keys,
and Langfuse arrives when there are LLM calls worth tracing.

## 2026-09-26 — Phase 1: ingestion rules
Data profile of `RAW_recipes.csv` (231,637 rows): 0 duplicate ids, 0 duplicate
ingredients within a recipe, all nutrition lists have 7 values, 1 recipe with no name
(`"-------------"`), 1 with no steps, 4,979 without description, 1,094 with `minutes = 0`,
2,000 over 24 h (max ≈ 2.1 billion).

- **Unusable recipes are skipped, not repaired.** A recipe with no name, no steps or no
  ingredients is dropped (2 rows in total) and counted in the build summary by reason.
  Alternative: fill the name from the description. Why: the one empty-name recipe has a
  meaningless description too, and 2 of 231k rows are not worth extra logic.
- **Minutes outliers are stored as-is** and excluded by the search filters (Phase 3).
  Why: the raw value stays inspectable, and the outlier rule lives in one place.
- **Ingestion only lowercases, trims and dedupes ingredient names.** `canonical_name`
  starts equal to `name`. "egg" and "eggs" stay separate until Phase 2 normalization.
  Why: keeps ingestion simple and makes the Phase 2 before/after measurable.
- **One `meal_type` and one `cuisine` per recipe via ordered tag lists** (first match wins,
  specific cuisine before broad region; see `db/tag_mapping.py`). All tags are still stored
  in `recipe_tags`. Known noise: tags are user-entered (e.g. sugar cookies tagged breakfast);
  60% of recipes have no cuisine tag.
- **`recipe_stats` from `RAW_interactions.csv`.** Rating 0 means "review without rating",
  so it counts in `n_reviews` but not in `avg_rating`.
- **Atomic, idempotent build.** The database is written to `pantry.db.tmp` and swapped in
  with `os.replace`, so a failed build never leaves a broken database.

Full build: 231,635 recipes, 14,941 unique ingredients, 2.1M recipe-ingredient rows,
551 tags, ~32 s on an M-series Mac.

Observation for Phase 2: a naive `LIKE '%egg%'` also matches "eggplant", "eggnog" and
"egg roll wrappers", which is why allergen labels must come from ingredient-level rules,
not substring search.

## 2026-09-26 — Quantity source: LLM estimates only (irkaal dropped)
Inspected `irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews` (522,517 recipes, same ids as Food.com)
as a source of ingredient quantities.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Our recipes found in irkaal | 99.9% |
| Units on quantities | none ("4" blueberries = 4 cups) |
| Name list and quantity list same length | 23% (the name list drops items) |
| Positions swapped even when all lists have equal length | ~8% (salt/pepper, butter/margarine) |
| Servings present | 64% |

Without units, only counted ingredients (eggs, garlic cloves, lemons...) have meaningful
numbers, and only when the ingredient name confirms the match: 27,356 counts in 23,795
recipes (~10%). This was built (PR #4) and then reverted.

**Decision:** do not use irkaal. All quantities (and servings) come from the Phase 8 LLM
estimator, cached and marked as estimates.
**Why:** ~10% coverage means the estimator is needed anyway; one quantity source keeps the
pipeline, the verifier and the setup (one dataset download instead of two) simpler.
**Trade-off accepted:** no ready-made ground truth for measuring the estimator; Phase 8
needs a small hand-labeled set instead. If that turns out costly, the irkaal counts can be
revisited as evaluation data (see the reverted PR #4 for the parser and alignment rules).
